Here is why this shows a win: 
This restricts your bet size to be under the bankroll. 
Assuming the $5 initial bet, this allows you to get 5 spins of losing in. 
This is happening because it doesn't subtract the bet until after the loss. 
When the program goes to calculate the total_lost, it is multiplying the games_cut_short by the bankroll. 
That bankroll does NOT reflect the actual amount you would lose if a game were cut short. 
The actual amount is dependent upon the bet size and bankroll. 
For example, a $5 bet with $100 bankroll means you would lose $155 on a game cut short. 

So this does NOT beat the house...this was a botched math...continue looking.
